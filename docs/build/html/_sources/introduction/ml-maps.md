# Machine Learning Assisted Systematic Maps

[Systematic maps](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0059-6) are a form of evidence synthesis product which aim to map out what has been researched in a particular domain.

Typically, these have been rather narrow, but with machine learning, we have the opportunity to map our entire research fields (like [climate impacts research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01168-6)), or [Climate and Health Research](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0059-6).

Using machine learning, we can more efficiently **identify** relevant literature, and **categorise** it, either according to pre-defined categories using *supervised learning*, or into open-ended categories using *unsupervised learning*.
