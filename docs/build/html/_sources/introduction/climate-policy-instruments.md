# A Machine Learning Assisted Map of Climate Policy Instruments

The project we are demonstrating is on climate policy instruments.

We are not on track to meet ambitious climate targets

```

To make progress, we will need to learn *fast* about what works under what conditions and why

There is a large literature on climate policy instruments, but it is widely dispersed and hard to systematize.

We aim to identify and map the literature on mitigation policies in this project, and categorise each paper according to the type of policy instruments they discuss, as well as the sector where emissions reductions are targeted.

In our paper, we also identify the countries mentioned, and compare the distribution of policy instrument literature to the distribution of actual policies and emissions.

But the dataset itself is useful if we can make it explorable. This is what we will do in this tutorial.
