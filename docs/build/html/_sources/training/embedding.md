# Embedding documents

When we fine-tune our model on our dataset, the model will first represent the documents in an embedded space.

We can use these embeddings to make nice visualisations.

## Dimensionality reduction

The embedding space our model uses will have hundreds of dimensions. Because we cannot make nice plots in so many dimensions, we need a way to
