# Evidence Synthesis

Evidence Synthesis refers to a set of formal methods to synthesise the results of existing studies.

For effective evidenced-based policymaking, we cannot rely on individual scientific studies to make decisions. There is a danger of cherrypicking evidence

Instead we need formal methods to identify all of the relevant evidence, critically assess it, and synthesise the results.
