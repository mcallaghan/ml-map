# Machine Learning for Evidence Synthesis

Evidence synthesis processes can be time-consuming. Traditionally, we search multiple databases, and review every document (at the title and abstract level) by hand, in order to determine its relevance to the review.


Increasing volumes of literature make this increasingly challenging

Machine learning can help to substitute **some** of the repetitive human labour involved in evidence synthesis processes.

There are now a wide variety of applications of machine learning in evidence synthesis ([Report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/new-technology-evidence-synthesis.pdf))
