# Machine Learning Assisted Systematic Maps

Systematic maps are a form of evidence synthesis product which aim to map out what has been researched in a particular domain.

Typically, these have been rather narrow, but with machine learning, we have the opportunity to map our entire research fields (like [climate impacts research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01168-6))
