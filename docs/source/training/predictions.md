# Putting our pipeline together

We now have all the elements we need to come up with a final model, estimate its performance, and use it to make predictions about the data we have not labelled.

Running this pipeline on the full dataset is computationally intensive, so it is written as a [script].

To run it, simply type

```

```

The following arguments define how this behaves.

Once you have run the script, you should regenerate the output data which is provided.

## Trial data

`.sql` contains the results of the trials. We can inspect these as follows:

## Final model performance

## Predictions
